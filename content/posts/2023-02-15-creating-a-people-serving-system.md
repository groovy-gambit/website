I﻿'m trying to create a people serving system, one which will be needed in a church group I go to.

W﻿e have about couple hundred on record but the system we use have been outdated, as PHP version has been dilapidated.

I﻿t's time to serve using the skills that God allowed me to have for the past 7 years.

M﻿y decision is this. I need to make this so that it is maintainable, cheaply extendable, and narrow-footprinted.

T﻿herefore React is out - we don't want huge JS stack which would also require a separate backend. That's enterprise way of doing things, one I'm used to at work, but this involves something I can be willing to maintain for ... at least 2~5 years.

I﻿ want to phase this out. The core feature needs to be small, and be easy to be extendable.

A﻿lso, since most of the interactions in our group revolves around a popular SNS tool, integrations with it is a very important feature - which means including one or more of:

* S﻿SO with the SNS
* C﻿hat group management
* C﻿hatbot capability to get list of peoples for notification easily
* C﻿hurch group assignment
* P﻿rayer / cell group report submission

.﻿.. once I get this working in Korean I'll start typing in Korean.
